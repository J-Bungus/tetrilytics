# tetrilytics

For the tens of thousands of players that play of Tetrio in any given moment, there has never been an effective way of checking the statistics of the player base. For those who wanted to know what the average winrate at S rank is, they would not be able to figure it out. Those who wanted to know the PPS or the APM of players in U rank, they would have no way of knowing either.

This is why I created Tetrio. It combines some of the features of Tetra League, where you can search for users and find some statistics regarding their ranked gamplay, with data visualisation for statistics on the entire playerbase. By interacting with the Tetrio API, Tetrilytics is able to bring a more holistic view on the statistics of the game of Tetris.

## Features
- Search individual users to get info including: rank, winrate, PPS, APM, and VS score
- View the top 100 leaderboards with player info
- View data visualisations of average PPS, APM, and VS Score at each rank for the whole player base
